# F1 WebApp

This is an F1 website clone application that provides users with an immersive experience of the world of Formula 1. The application has been designed to mimic the look and feel of the original F1 website, making it familiar and easy to navigate for fans of the sport.

One of the key features of the application is the ability for users to create an account and take full advantage of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for content. This allows users to add, delete and edit posts about their favorite drivers, teams and races. This feature makes the application highly interactive and allows users to participate in the community.

The application is fully responsive, which means it can be accessed from any device. This allows users to stay updated on the latest F1 news and information, whether they are at home, on the go or at the race track.

The application is built using a combination of technologies such as HTML, SCSS for styling, React for building the user interface, NextJS for server-rendering and TypeScript for type checking. The data management is handled by Apollo-Client, URQL, Formik, GraphQL, Express, Nodemailer, Type-GraphQL, TypeORM and PostgreSQL for the database. This combination of technologies ensures high performance, scalability and reliability for the application.

Another feature of the application is post pagination, which loads a limited amount of posts from the database at a time. This improves the user experience by avoiding long loading times and makes it easy to navigate through the posts. Additionally, the application has an automatic ranking of drivers and teams based on points, this feature allows users to see the current standings and progress of the teams and drivers.

Overall, this F1 website clone application provides a complete experience for fans of the sport, with a wide range of features, interactive functionality, and a responsive design that makes it accessible from anywhere.
